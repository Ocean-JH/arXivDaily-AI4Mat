- Generative models for materials
- Related computational materials science research

The search expression, result limit, and arXiv request pacing live in
[`config.json`](config.json). The default client requests 100 records per page,
waits 10 seconds between requests, and retries transient failures five times.
See the
[arXiv API query documentation](https://info.arxiv.org/help/api/user-manual.html#51-details-of-query-construction)
before adapting the query for another topic.

## Local setup

Python 3.13 is used in automation.

```bash
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
python -m pip install --upgrade pip
python -m pip install --requirement requirements.txt
python -m pip install --requirement requirements-dev.txt
npm install --ignore-scripts --no-package-lock
```

Run the tracker from the repository root:

```bash
python arxiv_tracker.py
```

The command contacts arXiv, updates the local paper state, and regenerates the
README, home page, archive pages, search index, feed, sitemap, and deployment
status. If arXiv remains unavailable with a rate-limit or server error after
the configured retries, an existing installation rebuilds from its latest
saved results so a temporary upstream outage does not block deployment. Review
the resulting diff before committing it.

## Architecture

- `arxiv_tracker.py` handles arXiv ingestion, version-aware deduplication, and
  durable state updates.
- `site_renderer.py` renders the paginated site, search data, feeds, sitemap,
  and health metadata from normalized paper records.
- `templates/` and `static/` contain the source HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and image
  assets.
- `data/known_papers.json` and `data/results/` are the durable ingestion state.
- `data/archive-search-index.json` is the compact public search index.
- `index.html`, `archive.html`, `archive/page-*.html`, `feed.xml`,
  `sitemap.xml`, and `site-status.json` are generated outputs.
- `scripts/prepare_site_artifact.py` validates generated HTML and assembles a
  strict allowlist of files for GitHub Pages.

The Pages artifact intentionally excludes Python source, templates, tests,
configuration, and ingestion-state files.

## Tests and validation

Run the same checks used by CI:

```bash
python -m pytest
python -m compileall -q arxiv_tracker.py site_renderer.py scripts tests
python -m ruff check .
python scripts/prepare_site_artifact.py check
for script in static/js/*.js; do node --check "$script"; done
npm run test:frontend
```

Pull requests and pushes to `main` run these checks without write permissions.

## Updates and deployment

The daily workflow runs at 06:00 Singapore time, on pushes to `main`, and when
manually dispatched. It tests the project before generation, commits generated
changes with the GitHub Actions bot, packages only public files, and deploys
them through the protected `github-pages` environment. A final smoke check
compares the deployed `site-status.json` timestamp with the artifact from the
same run, so a stale deployment fails visibly.

The deployment requires **GitHub Actions** under **Settings → Pages → Source**.
The workflow rejects every other publishing source before generation begins.
It uses the repository-provided token and requires no personal access token or
deployment secret.

### 1. ED-CSP: Crystal Structure Prediction from Electron Diffraction

**Authors:** Germain Poloudenny, Arnaud Demortière, Yaël Frégier

**Published:** 2026-08-06

**Category:** cs.LG

**ID:** 2608.06448v3

**Summary:** Recovering a periodic 3D crystal structure from sparse, unindexed electron diffraction (ED) observations is a challenging generative inverse problem. Existing ED-based learning methods mainly predict crystallographic labels, reconstruct structures from indexed reflections, or retrieve candidates from finite structure libraries. Here, we introduce ED-CSP, a machine learning framework that predicts crystal structures from chemical composition, atom count, and multiple detector-plane ED spot sets. ED-CSP combines a relational set encoder, permutation-invariant multi-view aggregation, and a periodic flow generator to jointly predict lattice parameters and fractional atomic coordinates.   To train the model, we construct ED-CS, a dataset of 4.85 million simulated multi-view ED crystal structures, deduplicated across seven materials repositories and filtered to exclude CHILI-100K overlaps. On 2,075 held-out CHILI-100K materials, ED-CSP trained only on CHILI achieves a structural match rate of 57.49% MR@5, outperforming PXRDGen (52.92%), a state-of-the-art crystal structure prediction model conditioned on powder X-ray diffraction. Scaling training data further improves performance: initializing from a one-million-structure precursor raises MR@5 to 66.27%. On 1,024 compositions absent from the training retrieval library, the model still achieves 53.52% MR@5, demonstrating true generative capability beyond exact-formula retrieval. Replacing target ED observations with diffraction from non-isomorphic structures of identical composition decreases MR@5 by 22.09 percentage points, confirming that predictions depend on the input diffraction patterns rather than composition alone. ED-CSP and ED-CS establish a benchmark for generative crystal structure prediction from sparse ED observations and provide a foundation for future transfer to experimental data.

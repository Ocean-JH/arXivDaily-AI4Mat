The search expression, result limit, and arXiv request pacing live in
[`config.json`](config.json). The default client requests up to 100 records per
page, retaining the configured 500-result search limit. Smaller pages reduce
response time and avoid repeatedly requesting a large response during arXiv
server failures. HTTP 5xx errors and read timeouts halve the failing page size
down to 25 records, keeping the same offset and using the smaller size for later
pages. Rate limits (HTTP 429) keep the same request and respect the cooldown.
Requests remain sequential with a 10-second delay between pages (at least
3 seconds is required by the [arXiv API terms](https://info.arxiv.org/help/api/tou.html)).
Temporary HTTP and network failures retry the same page up to five times, with
60, 120, 240, then 300-second backoff and a small random delay. The starting
backoff and cap are configurable through `arxiv_retry_backoff_seconds` and
`arxiv_retry_max_seconds`. Server `Retry-After` instructions take precedence,
including HTTP dates. Retries share a 15-minute wait budget across the search;
if a cooldown exceeds the remaining budget, the search stops instead of retrying
early. Requests have 10-second connection and 60-second read timeouts.
See the
[arXiv API query documentation](https://info.arxiv.org/help/api/user-manual.html#51-details-of-query-construction)
before adapting the query for another topic.

## Local setup

Python 3.13 is used in automation.

```bash
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
python -m pip install --upgrade pip
python -m pip install --requirement requirements.txt
python -m pip install --requirement requirements-dev.txt
npm install --ignore-scripts --no-package-lock
```

Run the tracker from the repository root:

```bash
python arxiv_tracker.py
```

The command contacts arXiv, updates the local paper state, and regenerates the
README, home page, archive pages, search index, feed, sitemap, and deployment
status. If arXiv remains unavailable with a rate-limit or server error after
the configured retries, an existing installation rebuilds from its latest
saved results so a temporary upstream outage does not block deployment. A failed
refresh displays a notice on the home page, records `"status": "stale"` in
`site-status.json`, and emits a GitHub Actions warning. A new generation timestamp
therefore does not imply a successful arXiv refresh. Review the resulting diff
before committing it.

## Architecture

- `arxiv_tracker.py` handles arXiv ingestion, version-aware deduplication, and
  durable state updates.
- `arxiv_client.py` adds bounded backoff and respects server cooldowns using
  the pinned `arxiv==2.2.0` client's parsing and pagination.
- `site_renderer.py` renders the paginated site, search data, feeds, sitemap,
  and health metadata from normalized paper records.
- `templates/` and `static/` contain the source HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and image
  assets.
- `data/known_papers.json` and `data/results/` are the durable ingestion state.
- `data/archive-search-index.json` is the compact public search index.
- `index.html`, `archive.html`, `archive/page-*.html`, `feed.xml`,
  `sitemap.xml`, and `site-status.json` are generated outputs.
- `scripts/prepare_site_artifact.py` validates generated HTML and assembles a
  strict allowlist of files for GitHub Pages.

The Pages artifact intentionally excludes Python source, templates, tests,
configuration, and ingestion-state files.

## Tests and validation

Run the same checks used by CI:

```bash
python -m pytest
python -m compileall -q arxiv_client.py arxiv_tracker.py site_renderer.py scripts tests
python -m ruff check .
python scripts/prepare_site_artifact.py check
for script in static/js/*.js; do node --check "$script"; done
npm run test:frontend
```

Pull requests and pushes to `main` run these checks without write permissions.

## Updates and deployment

The daily workflow runs at 06:00 Singapore time, on pushes to `main`, and when
manually dispatched. It tests the project before generation, commits generated
changes with the GitHub Actions bot, packages only public files, and deploys
them through the protected `github-pages` environment. A final smoke check
compares the deployed `site-status.json` timestamp with the artifact from the
same run and requires `"status": "ok"`. Saved content is still deployed during
an arXiv outage, but the workflow then fails explicitly so a successful
deployment cannot hide a failed refresh.

The deployment requires **GitHub Actions** under **Settings → Pages → Source**.
The workflow rejects every other publishing source before generation begins.
It uses the repository-provided token and requires no personal access token or
deployment secret.

### 1. Deep Generative Crystal Structure Prediction: A Benchmark Study and a Controlled Test of Prototype Dependence

**Authors:** Lai Wei, Rongzhi Dong, Ying Feng, Madeline Miklos, Jianjun Hu

**Published:** 2026-09-22

**Category:** cond-mat.mtrl-sci

**ID:** 2609.26502v2

**Link:** [https://arxiv.org/abs/2609.26502v2](https://arxiv.org/abs/2609.26502v2)

**Summary:** Deep generative models are widely reported to enable de novo crystal structure prediction (CSP), but their capability has not been measured consistently against template-based methods. We evaluate 12 representative generative CSP models, spanning latent-variable, diffusion, flow-matching, autoregressive, and manifold random-walk architectures, against TCSP 2.0 on 180 test structures and a leakage-controlled subset of 46. All methods use identical structure-matching, symmetry, and consensus criteria. Template retrieval is the strongest single method, reaching 68.3% top-1 success; symmetry-aware EquiCSP (66.4%) and Uni-3DAR (62.9%) form the next tier. However, comparison with TCSP 2.0 shows that most structures correctly predicted by generative models are also correctly predicted by template substitution. Thus, the set of structures uniquely reachable by generation is small, limiting its practical advantage for discovering structures outside existing prototype libraries. To test the source of this performance, we removed entire stoichiometric prototype families from the training set and retrained the strongest generative model. Accuracy declined by 50-78% across four families, establishing that performance is substantially prototype-dependent. A small minority of structures survived removal of their prototype family, demonstrating a real but limited retrieval-independent predictive capacity. Present generative CSP models therefore function largely as implicit, softer-edged prototype libraries rather than genuinely de novo predictors. Enlarging this residual capacity, rather than aggregate match rate alone, is the central open problem.

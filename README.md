The search expression, result limit, and arXiv request pacing live in
[`config.json`](config.json). The default client requests up to 500 records per
page, so the configured 500-result search normally needs just one request.
Requests remain sequential with a 10-second delay between pages (at least
3 seconds is required by the [arXiv API terms](https://info.arxiv.org/help/api/tou.html)).
Temporary HTTP and network failures retry the same page up to five times, with
60, 120, 240, then 300-second backoff and a small random delay. The starting
backoff and cap are configurable through `arxiv_retry_backoff_seconds` and
`arxiv_retry_max_seconds`. Server `Retry-After` instructions take precedence,
including HTTP dates. Retries share a 15-minute wait budget across the search;
if a cooldown exceeds the remaining budget, the search stops instead of retrying
early. Requests have 10-second connection and 60-second read timeouts.
See the
[arXiv API query documentation](https://info.arxiv.org/help/api/user-manual.html#51-details-of-query-construction)
before adapting the query for another topic.

## Local setup

Python 3.13 is used in automation.

```bash
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
python -m pip install --upgrade pip
python -m pip install --requirement requirements.txt
python -m pip install --requirement requirements-dev.txt
npm install --ignore-scripts --no-package-lock
```

Run the tracker from the repository root:

```bash
python arxiv_tracker.py
```

The command contacts arXiv, updates the local paper state, and regenerates the
README, home page, archive pages, search index, feed, sitemap, and deployment
status. If arXiv remains unavailable with a rate-limit or server error after
the configured retries, an existing installation rebuilds from its latest
saved results so a temporary upstream outage does not block deployment. A failed
refresh displays a notice on the home page, records `"status": "stale"` in
`site-status.json`, and emits a GitHub Actions warning. A new generation timestamp
therefore does not imply a successful arXiv refresh. Review the resulting diff
before committing it.

## Architecture

- `arxiv_tracker.py` handles arXiv ingestion, version-aware deduplication, and
  durable state updates.
- `arxiv_client.py` adds bounded backoff and respects server cooldowns using
  the pinned `arxiv==2.2.0` client's parsing and pagination.
- `site_renderer.py` renders the paginated site, search data, feeds, sitemap,
  and health metadata from normalized paper records.
- `templates/` and `static/` contain the source HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and image
  assets.
- `data/known_papers.json` and `data/results/` are the durable ingestion state.
- `data/archive-search-index.json` is the compact public search index.
- `index.html`, `archive.html`, `archive/page-*.html`, `feed.xml`,
  `sitemap.xml`, and `site-status.json` are generated outputs.
- `scripts/prepare_site_artifact.py` validates generated HTML and assembles a
  strict allowlist of files for GitHub Pages.

The Pages artifact intentionally excludes Python source, templates, tests,
configuration, and ingestion-state files.

## Tests and validation

Run the same checks used by CI:

```bash
python -m pytest
python -m compileall -q arxiv_client.py arxiv_tracker.py site_renderer.py scripts tests
python -m ruff check .
python scripts/prepare_site_artifact.py check
for script in static/js/*.js; do node --check "$script"; done
npm run test:frontend
```

Pull requests and pushes to `main` run these checks without write permissions.

## Updates and deployment

The daily workflow runs at 06:00 Singapore time, on pushes to `main`, and when
manually dispatched. It tests the project before generation, commits generated
changes with the GitHub Actions bot, packages only public files, and deploys
them through the protected `github-pages` environment. A final smoke check
compares the deployed `site-status.json` timestamp with the artifact from the
same run, so a stale deployment fails visibly.

The deployment requires **GitHub Actions** under **Settings → Pages → Source**.
The workflow rejects every other publishing source before generation begins.
It uses the repository-provided token and requires no personal access token or
deployment secret.

### 1. Knowledge-Driven XRD Phase Identification via Multi-View Retrieval and Explanation

**Authors:** Doaa Mohamed, Markus Stricker

**Published:** 2026-09-25

**Category:** cond-mat.mtrl-sci

**ID:** 2609.31888v1

**Link:** [https://arxiv.org/abs/2609.31888v1](https://arxiv.org/abs/2609.31888v1)

**Summary:** X-ray diffraction (XRD) is a experimental technique for determining the phase composition and structure of crystalline materials. However, interpreting XRD patterns is challenging, particularly in high-throughput materials discovery, where many novel materials may need to be characterized and no reference patterns are available. Consequently, machine learning is increasingly used to accelerate and automate the analysis while reducing errors associated with human interpretation. We propose a multi-decision framework for XRD phase analysis that integrates representation learning, similarity-based retrieval, and explainable decision support within a unified reference database. A convolutional autoencoder learns compact latent representations of XRD patterns that preserve structural similarity while remaining robust to variations arising from experimental noise and measurement conditions. By integrating multiple decision pathways within a shared latent space, the framework moves beyond single-label prediction toward ranked and interpretable phase analysis that mirrors expert practice. During inference, complementary decision mechanisms are applied, including latent-space classification and retrieval, explanation-guided similarity using Integrated Gradients, and composition-based similarity search. These mechanisms generate ranked candidate phase lists that are aggregated into a final prediction with an associated confidence score. Experiments on synthetic datasets demonstrate strong predictive performance, achieving 98.85\\,\\% accuracy for crystal system classification and 95.82\\,\\% accuracy for space group prediction on the test set, while maintaining robustness under realistic perturbations. The framework supports reliable, analyst-friendly identification of crystal phases and structures in high-throughput and exploratory materials discovery settings.
